The documentation is created on 19th July 2019.

This Python script is written for  Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) course and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

For this project to work you need to install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

The file included in the project is only bikeshare.py which gives the code which is user for the data manipulation

The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

What is the most popular month for start time?
What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
What is the most popular trip?
What are the counts of each user type?
What are the counts of gender?
What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?


I have done this project based on the information learnt from the Udacity Site
